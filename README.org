# OIM 390STA: ETL Example

Contains the following:
- =analyze_lfg_logs.ipynb=: Jupyter notebook for analyzing LFG logs
- =logs.txt=: Text file containing LFG logs
- =lfg_data.csv=: Expected Output

## Practice Task

Write a ETL script that extracts the LFG logs from the text file, transforms the data into a structured format, and loads it into a CSV file. My process of doing this is detailed in the included Jupyter notebook and my output in the lfg_data.csv file.
